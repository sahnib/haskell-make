# haskell-make
This is a simple GNU "Make" command implementation in haskell. I aim to get my hands dirty o haskell with this implementaion. 

## Build Steps:
clone the repo; cd haskell-make;
    
    $ cabal sandbox init
    $ cabal build

## Current status:
- parses the Makefile and creates a dependency tree.
